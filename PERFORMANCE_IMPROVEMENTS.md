# Performance Improvements - Alpha Wallet Rotation & Quality Fixes

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: Bot made trades successfully after alpha wallet discovery, but then stopped making trades as time went on, suggesting alpha wallets were going stale.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Critical Bug**: Wallet tracker was breaking at 1 alpha wallet instead of waiting for the configured threshold (e.g., 3 wallets)
2. **Stale Cache**: 30-minute token cache was too long for the fast-moving pump.fun ecosystem
3. **Slow Rotation**: 6-hour alpha discovery cycle was too slow for wallet turnover
4. **No Inactive Tracking**: No system to detect when wallets stopped being active

## 🛠️ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Critical Bug Fix - Quality Gate** ✅
**File**: `src/core/wallet_tracker.py`
**Problem**: Line 122-123 was breaking at `>= 1` instead of using the configured threshold
**Fix**: 
```python
# Before (WRONG):
if len(alpha_buyers) >= 1:  # Return early if we have at least one
    break

# After (CORRECT):
if len(alpha_buyers) >= threshold_alpha_buys:
    self.logger.info(f"Threshold reached: {len(alpha_buyers)}/{threshold_alpha_buys} alpha wallets")
    break
```
**Impact**: Now properly waits for 3+ wallet convergence instead of taking low-quality single-wallet signals.

### 2. **Faster Token Cache** ✅
**File**: `main.py`
**Problem**: 30-minute cache prevented retrying tokens when better data became available
**Fix**: 
```python
# Before:
self.token_cache_duration = 1800  # 30 minutes

# After:
self.token_cache_duration = 600   # 10 minutes
```
**Impact**: Allows retrying tokens sooner when initial analysis was incomplete.

### 3. **Faster Alpha Discovery** ✅
**Files**: 
- `scripts/alpha_discovery_scheduler.py`
- `src/discovery/alpha_discovery_v2.py`

**Problem**: 6-hour rotation cycle was too slow for pump.fun wallet turnover
**Fix**:
```python
# Before:
await asyncio.sleep(6 * 3600)  # 6 hours

# After:  
await asyncio.sleep(2 * 3600)  # 2 hours
```
**Impact**: 3x faster wallet rotation means fresher alpha wallets and better signal quality.

### 4. **Inactive Wallet Tracking** ✅
**File**: `src/core/wallet_tracker.py`
**Problem**: No way to detect when alpha wallets stopped being active
**Fix**: Added comprehensive inactive wallet tracking:
```python
# New tracking variables
self.wallet_last_activity = {}  # {wallet: timestamp}
self.inactive_threshold_hours = 6  # Mark as inactive after 6 hours
self.inactive_wallets = set()  # Wallets that haven't traded recently

# New methods
def update_wallet_activity(self, wallet_address: str)
def check_inactive_wallets(self)
def get_active_wallets(self) -> Set[str]
def get_inactive_wallets(self) -> Set[str]
```
**Impact**: Automatically tracks wallet activity and can exclude inactive wallets from analysis.

## 📊 Expected Performance Impact

### **Quality Improvements**:
- **Higher Win Rate**: Bug fix ensures only high-confidence trades (3+ wallet signals)
- **Better Timing**: 10-minute cache allows catching tokens with improving fundamentals
- **Fresher Signals**: 2-hour discovery cycle keeps wallet list current

### **Signal Freshness**:
- **3x Faster Rotation**: Discovery every 2 hours vs 6 hours
- **Activity Tracking**: Can identify and potentially exclude inactive wallets
- **Better Coverage**: Faster cache expiration means fewer missed opportunities

### **Risk Reduction**:
- **No More Single-Wallet Trades**: Critical bug fix prevents low-quality signals
- **Adaptive Monitoring**: Inactive wallet detection prevents following stale wallets
- **Maintained Standards**: Still requires proven 24-48 hour validation for wallet promotion

## 🔍 How to Monitor Improvements

### **Key Metrics to Watch**:
1. **Trade Frequency**: Should maintain steady rate throughout the day
2. **Signal Quality**: More consistent 3+ wallet convergence events
3. **Win Rate**: Should improve due to higher quality thresholds
4. **Wallet Freshness**: Check logs for inactive wallet notifications

### **Log Messages to Monitor**:
```
# Good signals (new):
"Threshold reached: 3/3 alpha wallets"

# Inactive wallet detection:
"Wallet abc123... marked as inactive (no activity for 6h)"
"Marked 2 wallets as inactive: ['abc123...', 'def456...']"

# Discovery frequency:
"Will run discovery every 2 hours (reduced from 6 for fresher wallets)"
```

## 🎯 Why This Approach Works

### **Surgical Fixes vs Over-Engineering**:
- ✅ **Fixed Real Bugs**: Addressed actual logic errors in the code
- ✅ **Simple & Testable**: Each change is isolated and easy to verify
- ✅ **Preserved Sophistication**: Kept the proven 24-48 hour validation system
- ❌ **Avoided Complexity**: No complex tier systems or micro-optimizations

### **Balanced Approach**:
- **Quality**: Fixed the critical >= 1 bug that was letting low-quality trades through
- **Speed**: Reduced cache time and discovery interval for freshness
- **Intelligence**: Added activity tracking without complex scoring systems
- **Reliability**: All changes maintain existing error handling and logging

## ⚡ Quick Test

To verify the fixes work:
1. **Start the bot** and watch for the new log messages
2. **Check threshold behavior**: Should see "Threshold reached: X/Y alpha wallets" 
3. **Monitor discovery**: Should run every 2 hours instead of 6
4. **Watch activity tracking**: Will mark wallets inactive after 6 hours of no trades

These simple fixes should resolve the "trades dry up over time" issue while maintaining the sophisticated alpha wallet validation that makes the system effective.
