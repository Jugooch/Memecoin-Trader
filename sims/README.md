# Strategy Simulation Engine - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This simulation engine monitors real-time alpha wallet trades and tests three different trading strategies **without risking real money**. It collects actual market data to determine which strategy performs best, allowing us to optimize our trading approach based on hard data rather than assumptions.

## What This Proves

### Core Questions We're Answering:
1. **Are we exiting too early?** - Do tokens pump after we hit stop loss?
2. **Is volatility buffer worth it?** - Do more tokens recover after initial dips?
3. **Are we missing late entries?** - Do tokens with 4+ alpha wallets still pump?
4. **What's our real win rate?** - Which strategy has the best risk/reward?

### Expected Insights:
- **If Buffer Strategy wins**: Our stop losses are too tight, we're panic selling during normal volatility
- **If Late Alpha Strategy wins**: We should wait for more confirmation before entering
- **If Current Strategy wins**: Our current approach is already optimal

## Three Strategies Being Tested

### Strategy 1: "Current Implementation"
**Simulates our existing bot behavior**
- ‚úÖ **Entry**: 1+ alpha wallet, within 15 seconds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Stop Loss**: -15% immediately (aggressive)
- üéØ **Take Profit**: 20% (full exit)
- üïê **Issues**: Panic sells during volatility, can't execute due to indexing delays

### Strategy 2: "Buffer Strategy" 
**Proposed improvement with volatility buffer**
- ‚úÖ **Entry**: Same as current (1+ alpha, 15s)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Buffer**: No stop losses for first 60 seconds
- üìà **Take Profits**: Still allowed during buffer (catch pumps!)
- üí∞ **Multi-tier**: TP1(20%/45%), TP2(50%/35%), TP3(100%/15%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Stop Loss**: -35% after buffer period (wider)

### Strategy 3: "Late Alpha Strategy"
**Tests waiting for more confirmation**
- ‚è∞ **Entry**: 4+ alpha wallets, within 5 minutes
- üõ°Ô∏è **Buffer**: Same as Strategy 2 (already late entry)
- üí° **Hypothesis**: More alphas = higher success rate

  - Late Alpha: 4+ alphas, ‚â§300s delay
- [ ] **Exit condition engines**: 
  - Current: -15% stop, +20% TP
  - Buffer: 60s buffer, -35% stop, multi-tier TPs
  - Late Alpha: Same as buffer
- [ ] **Position tracking**: Track virtual positions with real price updates
- [ ] **Partial exit simulation**: Handle multi-tier profit taking

#### Phase 4: Data Management üíæ
- [ ] **JSON storage system**: Save results to strategy-specific files
- [ ] **Real-time updates**: Update positions every 5 seconds

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues:
- **Import errors**: Check parent directory path in sys.path
- **API failures**: Verify PumpPortal/Moralis keys in config
- **No alpha signals**: Confirm watched_wallets list is populated  
- **Price data missing**: Check Moralis rate limits and API status
- **JSON errors**: Verify write permissions in sims/data/ directory

### Debug Mode:
- Set logging level to DEBUG for verbose output
- Monitor sims/logs/ for detailed error messages
- Check active_positions count in JSON files
- Verify alpha_signals dictionary population

This simulation engine will provide concrete data to optimize our trading strategy and maximize profitability based on real market behavior rather than theoretical assumptions.
