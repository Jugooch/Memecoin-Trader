# Frontrun Bot - Current State & Mainnet Deployment Plan

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: ‚úÖ Phase 4 Complete ‚Üí Moving to Geyser Integration & Mainnet
**Strategy**: Initial Dev Buy Frontrunning on Pump.fun

---

## üìä Bot Overview

**What it does**: Frontrun the initial developer buy on brand new Pump.fun token launches. When a dev creates a token and makes their first buy (typically 0.5-2 SOL), we insert our buy transaction before theirs with aggressive priority fees, then immediately sell after their buy confirms and pumps the price 2-10x.

**Why this works**:
- Bonding curve is **empty** at token creation = maximum price impact
- Dev's first buy creates **massive price movement** (2-10x)
- **Systematic pattern** = same every token launch, highly optimizable
- **Fast exit** = 5-20 second hold time, minimal risk

**Target Performance**:
- Latency: <100ms total (detect ‚Üí submit)
- Win Rate: 70-80% of races won
- Profit per Win: 100-500% return
- Hold Time: 5-20 seconds

**Key Innovation**: Defensive guardrails prevent fee burn and silent degradation

### **Phase 4: COMPLETE** (Frontrun Detection + Guardrails)

**Defensive Guardrails** (Production-Ready) ‚úÖ:
- **Latency Budget Enforcer** - Hard abort semantics, circuit breaker (automatically tracks violations)
- **Profit-Aware Fee Cap** - Never bid >30% of p25 profit estimate, cold-start protection (50k lamports max until 10 trades)
- **RPC Health Scoring** - Auto-routing to best endpoint, fast ejection on degradation
- **Race Failure Detector** - Win/loss classification for strategy validation

**Frontrun Features** (Simplified & Ready) ‚úÖ:

- **Dev Buy Confirmation Detector** - <200ms confirmation latency
- **Mempool Monitor** - Stub ready for Geyser integration
- **Frontrun Orchestrator** - Coordinates all components with guardrails

**Phase 4 Code**:
- 7 new production files (~2,900 lines)
- **41 unit tests passing** (all 8 latency enforcer tests fixed ‚úÖ)
- 3 integration tests (simulation mode)
- All defensive guardrails working

**Total Tests**: 357 passing (316 + 41)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Geyser integration and mainnet deployment

---

## üéØ Simplified Strategy: Initial Dev Buy Only

**Target**: First buy on brand new tokens (<60 seconds old)

**Why not frontrun all large buys?**
- Initial dev buy = **empty curve** = 2-10x price impact
- Random buys = **full curve** = only 10-30% price impact
- Initial dev buy = **systematic** = same pattern every time
- Random buys = **unpredictable** = unknown outcome
- **EV Comparison**: Initial dev buy (~140% EV) vs Random buys (~12% EV)

**Detection Logic**:
```python
if (
    program_id == PUMP_FUN_PROGRAM_ID AND
    buy_amount_sol >= 0.5 AND
    token_age_seconds < 60  # Brand new token
):
    # This is a high-EV frontrun opportunity
    execute_frontrun()
```

## üöÄ Mainnet Deployment Plan - 4 Phases

### **Phase 1: Monitoring Mode** (Week 1)
**Goal**: Collect real data without trading

### **Phase 2: Micro-Trading** (Days 1-3 of Week 2)
**Goal**: Validate logic with 10-20 tiny trades

### **Phase 3: Single-Wallet Production** (Rest of Week 2 + Week 3)
**Goal**: Prove profitability with 1 wallet

### **Phase 4: Horizontal Scaling** (Week 4+)
**Goal**: Add wallets as capital grows

---

## üìä Phase 1: Monitoring Mode (Week 1)

**Objective**: Observe real mainnet activity, collect data, NO TRADING

**Infrastructure Setup**:
1. **Sign up for Geyser access**
   - Recommended: Helius Professional ($499/month) - includes RPC + Geyser
   - Alternative: Triton Geyser ($200/month) + separate RPC

2. **Implement real mempool monitor**
   - Replace stub in `services/mempool_monitor.py`
   - Connect to Geyser gRPC endpoint
   - Subscribe to Pump.fun program (6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P)
   - Filter for initial dev buys (first buy on new token >= 0.5 SOL)

3. **Run orchestrator in MONITORING MODE**
   ```python
   orchestrator = FrontrunOrchestrator(
       monitoring_mode=True,  # Log opportunities, don't trade
       config=OrchestratorConfig(
           detector_config=DetectorConfig(min_buy_amount_sol=0.5)
       )
   )
   await orchestrator.start()
   ```

**Data to Collect** (1 week of monitoring):

**Opportunity Metrics**:
- How many new tokens created per day?
- How many initial dev buys >= 0.5 SOL per day?
- Average initial dev buy size?
- Distribution of buy sizes (0.5-1 SOL, 1-2 SOL, 2+ SOL)?
- Time from token creation to first buy (median/p95)?

**Competition Analysis**:
- How many other addresses trying to frontrun?
- What fees are competitors using? (analyze priority fees on competing txs)
- What's their win rate? (who gets in first?)
- What position sizes are they using?

**Latency Analysis**:
- Our detection latency (Geyser event ‚Üí opportunity detected)?
- Time available to build transaction (detection ‚Üí dev buy lands)?
- Can we consistently stay under 100ms total latency?

**Profitability Simulation**:
- For each opportunity, calculate: "If we had frontrun with X SOL and Y fee, what would PnL be?"
- Estimate win rate based on: "Would our fee have been high enough?"
- Build expected value model: `EV = P_win √ó Profit_win - P_loss √ó Loss_loss - Avg_Fee`

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Geyser connection stable for 7 days (>99% uptime)
- ‚úÖ Detecting 10-50+ initial dev buy opportunities per day
- ‚úÖ Simulated win rate >60% (using conservative fee estimates)
- ‚úÖ Simulated EV >0 after fees
- ‚úÖ Our latency <100ms on 90% of events

**Deliverable**: Monitoring report with:
- Opportunity count and distribution
- Competition analysis (how many competitors, their fees)
- Simulated P&L if we had traded
- Go/No-Go recommendation for Phase 2

**Cost**: $499/month (Helius) or $200-300/month (Triton + RPC)

---

## üß™ Phase 2: Micro-Trading (Days 1-3 of Week 2)

**Objective**: Validate our logic works with TINY position sizes (10-20 trades)

**Configuration**:
- **1 wallet** funded with 1 SOL (~$250)
- **Position size**: 0.005-0.01 SOL per trade ($1.25-$2.50 per attempt)
- **Max positions**: 1 at a time
- **All guardrails enabled**
- **Manual monitoring** of every trade (It still happens automatically, but I want to be able to see/debug EVERYTHING its doing)

**Setup**:
```python
orchestrator = FrontrunOrchestrator(
    config=OrchestratorConfig(
        default_buy_amount_sol=0.005,  # ~$7.50 per trade
        max_slippage_bps=1000,  # 10% (aggressive for testing)
        detector_config=DetectorConfig(min_buy_amount_sol=0.5),
        latency_config=LatencyConfig(total_budget_ms=100.0)
    )
)
```

**Execution Plan**:
1. Enable real trading mode (not simulation)
2. Execute 10-20 micro-trades over a days
3. After EACH trade, manually review:
   - Did we detect the opportunity correctly?
   - Did our transaction land before dev buy?
   - Did we exit successfully after dev buy confirmed?
   - What was actual PnL?
   - What fees did we pay?
   - Any errors or issues?

**Metrics to Track**:
| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Trades Executed | 10-20 | Enough data for validation |
| Win Rate | >60% | Are we beating competition? |
| Avg Profit per Win | >0.01 SOL | Are wins profitable? (This should be validated after we use REAL position sizes) |
| Avg Loss per Loss | <0.005 SOL | Are losses contained? (This should be validated after we use REAL position sizes) |
| Avg Fee per Trade | <0.005 SOL | Are fees reasonable? |
| Latency p95 | <100ms | Are we fast enough? |
| Circuit Breaker Trips | 0 | Are guardrails working? |
| Errors | 0 | Is logic sound? |

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ 10-20 trades executed without critical bugs
- ‚úÖ Win rate >60%
- ‚úÖ Net PnL >0 (even if small) (This should be validated after we use REAL position sizes)
- ‚úÖ All guardrails functioning (no fee burn, no late submissions)
- ‚úÖ Average latency <100ms
- ‚úÖ No wallet management issues (locking, cooldowns work)

**Failure Conditions** (STOP if any occur):
- ‚ùå Win rate <40% (we're not competitive)
- ‚ùå Net PnL <0 after 20 trades (strategy not profitable)
- ‚ùå Circuit breaker trips >3 times (latency issues)
- ‚ùå Any critical bug (incorrect trade logic, wallet issues, etc.)

**If Success** ‚Üí Move to Phase 3
**If Failure** ‚Üí Analyze issues:
- If latency problem ‚Üí Tune budgets, optimize code
- If fee problem ‚Üí Analyze competition, adjust fee multipliers
- If logic problem ‚Üí Fix bugs, add tests, re-validate

**Capital at Risk**: 1 SOL (~$250) - Conservative enough to test without significant loss

**Deliverable**: Micro-trading report with:
- Per-trade breakdown (all 10-20 trades)
- Win rate and PnL analysis
- Latency statistics
- Issues encountered and fixes
- Go/No-Go recommendation for Phase 3

---

## üí∞ Phase 3: Single-Wallet Production (Rest of Week 2 + Week 3)

**Objective**: Prove profitability at realistic scale with 1 wallet

**Configuration**:
- **1 wallet** funded with 2 SOL (~$500)
- **Position size**: 0.2 SOL per trade (~$50 per attempt)
- **Max positions**: 1 at a time
- **All guardrails enabled**
- **Automated operation** (no manual review per trade)
- **Daily monitoring** of aggregate stats

**Why 0.2 SOL position size?**
- With 2 SOL in wallet, we can do ~8-10 trades before needing to add capital
- At $250/SOL, 0.2 SOL = $50 per trade = meaningful but not huge risk
- If we win 70% at 200% avg profit: `0.7 √ó 0.4 SOL = 0.28 SOL profit per trade`
- If we lose 30% at 100% avg loss: `0.3 √ó 0.2 SOL = 0.06 SOL loss per trade`
- **Net per trade**: ~0.22 SOL profit = $55 per successful attempt

**Setup**:
```python
orchestrator = FrontrunOrchestrator(
    config=OrchestratorConfig(
        default_buy_amount_sol=0.2,  # $50 per trade
        max_slippage_bps=1000,  # 10%
        detector_config=DetectorConfig(min_buy_amount_sol=0.5),
        latency_config=LatencyConfig(total_budget_ms=100.0),
        bidder_config=BidderConfig(profit_cap_pct=0.3)  # Never pay >30% of expected profit in fees
    )
)
```

**Execution Plan**:
1. Run continuously for 1-2 weeks
2. Daily review of stats (not individual trades):
   - Total attempts
   - Win rate
   - Daily PnL
   - Fee burn
   - Avg latency
   - Circuit breaker trips
   - Any errors

3. Add capital as needed (if we're profitable and running low on SOL)

**Metrics to Track** (Daily):
| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Trades per Day | 5-20 | - |
| Win Rate | >70% | STOP if <60% for 3 days |
| Daily PnL | Positive | STOP if negative 3 days in row |
| Fee Burn / PnL Ratio | <0.25 | STOP if >0.35 for 24 hours |
| Avg Latency | <100ms | STOP if >150ms on 80% of trades |
| Circuit Breaker Trips | 0-2 per day | STOP if >10 per day |

**Success Criteria** (After 1-2 weeks):
- ‚úÖ Win rate >70%
- ‚úÖ Cumulative PnL >0.5 SOL (2x our position size, proves profitability)
- ‚úÖ Fee burn / realized PnL <0.25
- ‚úÖ System stable (>99% uptime, no critical bugs)
- ‚úÖ Guardrails working (circuit breaker never trips >10x per day)

**Stop Conditions** (Pause immediately if):
- ‚ùå Win rate <60% for 50+ attempts
- ‚ùå Cumulative PnL <0 after 100 attempts
- ‚ùå Fee burn / PnL >0.35 for 24 hours
- ‚ùå Circuit breaker trips >10 times in one day
- ‚ùå Any critical bug (position not tracked, wallet locked, etc.)

**If Success** ‚Üí Move to Phase 4 (Horizontal Scaling)
**If Failure** ‚Üí Either:
- Pause and optimize (if fixable issues)
- Abandon strategy (if fundamentally unprofitable)

**Capital at Risk**: 2 SOL (~$500) per wallet

**Deliverable**: Single-wallet production report with:
- Week 1 results (trades, win rate, PnL)
- Week 2 results (if continued)
- Cumulative P&L
- Fee analysis (avg fee paid, fee/PnL ratio)
- Latency statistics
- Go/No-Go recommendation for scaling

---

## üìà Phase 4: Horizontal Scaling (Week 4+)

**Objective**: Add wallets incrementally as capital and confidence grow

**Scaling Plan**:

**Step 1: Add Wallet #2** (After 1-2 weeks of profitable Phase 3)
- Fund wallet #2 with 2 SOL
- Run 2 wallets in parallel
- Verify wallet rotation works correctly (no conflicts)
- Monitor for 3-5 days
- If stable and profitable ‚Üí Continue

**Step 2: Add Wallet #3-5** (After wallet #2 proven)
- Add 1 new wallet per week
- Fund each with 2 SOL (~$500)
- Monitor wallet rotation (cooldowns, locking working?)
- Target: 5 wallets total = 10 SOL capital (~$2,500)

**Step 3: Optimize Position Sizing** (After 5 wallets stable)
- If win rate >75%, increase position size: 0.2 ‚Üí 0.3 SOL
- If capital growing, increase wallet funding: 2 ‚Üí 3 SOL per wallet
- Never increase beyond 50% of wallet balance per trade (risk management)

**Step 4: Continue Scaling** (As capital allows)
- Add wallets gradually (1-2 per week max)
- Target: 10 wallets = 20-30 SOL capital (~$5,000-7,500)
- At 10 wallets √ó 0.2 SOL positions √ó 5 trades/day = potential for 10 SOL daily volume

**Scaling Configuration**:
```python
# Multi-wallet setup
wallet_manager = WalletManager(
    wallet_config=WalletConfig(
        min_balance_sol=0.2,  # Minimum balance required to trade
        cooldown_between_trades_s=60,  # 1 minute cooldown per wallet
        max_concurrent_positions=1  # One position per wallet max
    )
)

# Wallets:
# Wallet 1: 2 SOL
# Wallet 2: 2 SOL
# Wallet 3: 2 SOL
# ... (add more as capital allows)
```

**Metrics to Track** (As we scale):
| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Wallets Active | Increase gradually | Smooth scaling |
| Total Capital | Grows with profit | Compound returns |
| Daily Volume | 10-50 SOL | More opportunities |
| Win Rate | Stable >70% | Strategy still works at scale |
| Daily PnL | Increasing | More volume = more profit |
| Wallet Utilization | 60-80% | Each wallet trading regularly |

**Capital Allocation Strategy**:
1. **Start**: 1 wallet, 2 SOL ($500)
2. **After profitable week 1**: Add wallet #2 (+$500) = 2 wallets, 4 SOL ($1,000)
3. **After profitable week 2**: Add wallet #3 (+$500) = 3 wallets, 6 SOL ($1,500)
4. **Continue**: Add 1 wallet per week from profits
5. **Target**: 10 wallets, 20 SOL ($5,000) within 2-3 months

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Linear scaling (2x wallets = ~2x daily PnL)
- ‚úÖ Win rate stays >70% as we scale
- ‚úÖ No wallet management issues (locking, rotation works)
- ‚úÖ System stable at scale (>99% uptime with 10 wallets)

**Risk Management**:
- Never scale beyond our ability to monitor
- Never add wallets during a losing streak
- Always keep 20% of capital in reserve (for gas, emergencies)
- If win rate drops below 65%, pause scaling and investigate

## üìã Geyser Integration - Implementation Details

### **Step 1: Sign Up & Setup** (Day 1)

**Option A: Helius (Recommended)**:
1. Go to https://helius.dev
2. Sign up for Professional plan ($499/month)
3. Get Geyser gRPC endpoint from dashboard (format: `grpc.helius.com:443`)
4. Get API key

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies** (Day 1)

```bash
cd frontrun
pip install grpcio>=1.60.0 grpcio-tools>=1.60.0
```

### **Step 3: Update Mempool Monitor** (Days 1-2)

```python
# Test script
import asyncio
from services.mempool_monitor import MempoolMonitor

async def test_geyser():
    monitor = MempoolMonitor(
        geyser_endpoint="grpc.helius.com:443",
        api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
    )

    async def on_tx(tx):
        print(f"Received transaction: {tx.signature[:16]}...")

    await monitor.start_monitoring(on_tx)

asyncio.run(test_geyser())
```

Expected output: Real-time stream of Pump.fun transactions

### **Step 5: Enable Monitoring Mode** (Day 3+)

Update orchestrator to use real monitor:

```python
# Before (stub):
mempool_monitor = MempoolMonitor(MempoolConfig())

# After (real):
mempool_monitor = RealGeyserMonitor(
    geyser_endpoint=os.getenv("GEYSER_ENDPOINT"),
    api_key=os.getenv("GEYSER_API_KEY")
)
```

Run in monitoring mode for 1 week to collect data.
