  - Technical: WebSocket/QUIC connection pooling, automatic reconnection with exponential backoff, heartbeat
  monitoring
  - Why we need it: Any low-latency strategy needs redundant, fast RPC access

  2. Transaction Builder (Base)

  - Technical: Serializes instructions, computes recent blockhash, handles account metas, creates versioned
  transactions
  - Why we need it: Both strategies need to build buy/sell transactions quickly

  3. Transaction Signer

  - What: Signs transactions with hot wallet keys
  - Technical: Ed25519 signature generation, key management in memory, secure key rotation
  - Why we need it: Any automated trading requires signing

  4. Transaction Submitter

  - What: Broadcasts signed transactions to Solana network
  - Technical: HTTP POST to sendTransaction RPC method, retry logic, timeout handling
  - Why we need it: Both need to submit transactions

  5. Multi-Wallet Manager

  - What: Manages pool of trading wallets
  - Technical: Wallet rotation, SOL balance tracking, nonce management, concurrent wallet operations
  - Why we need it: Both strategies use multiple wallets for concurrency/safety

  6. Priority Fee Calculator

  - What: Computes optimal compute unit price for transaction inclusion
  - Technical: Queries getRecentPrioritizationFees, analyzes network congestion, calculates CU limits
  - Why we need it: Both need transactions included quickly

  7. Pump.fun Program Client (Base)

  - What: Encodes/decodes pump.fun program instructions
  - Technical: Knows program ID, instruction discriminators, account ordering for buy/sell
  - Why we need it: Both trade on pump.fun

  8. Bonding Curve Calculator

  - What: Computes price from bonding curve state
  - Technical: Reads virtual SOL/token reserves, applies bonding curve formula (usually x*y=k or similar)
  - Why we need it: Both need to know price impact

  9. Slippage Manager

  - What: Enforces max slippage tolerance on trades
  - Technical: Calculates minimum output tokens, sets slippage bounds in instruction
  - Why we need it: Both need slippage protection

  10. Position Tracker

  - What: Tracks open positions per wallet
  - Technical: Maps wallet â†’ {token, entry_price, amount, entry_slot}
  - Why we need it: Both need to know what's held

  11. PnL Calculator

  - What: Calculates profit/loss for positions
  - Technical: (exit_price - entry_price) * amount - fees
  - Why we need it: Both measure performance

  12. Metrics & Logging System

  - What: Structured logging and performance metrics
  - Technical: JSON logs, latency histograms (p50/p95/p99), throughput counters, error rates
  - Why we need it: Both need observability

  13. Health Monitor

  - What: Monitors system health and RPC availability
  - Technical: Ping/pong to RPCs, measures RTT, tracks slot lag, monitors CPU/memory
  - Why we need it: Both need to detect degradation

  14. Configuration Manager

  - What: Loads runtime configuration
  - Technical: YAML/JSON parsing, environment variable support, hot-reload capability
  - Why we need it: Both need configurable parameters

  15. Mempool Transaction Monitor

  - What: Listens to pending/unconfirmed transactions
  - Technical: Geyser plugin subscription or specialized RPC endpoint that streams pending tx before block inclusion
  - Why we need it: Frontrunning requires seeing transactions before they land

  16. Dev Wallet Pattern Detector

  - What: Identifies developer wallet behavior patterns
  - Technical: Tracks wallet addresses known to execute dev buys, detects signature patterns of dev buy transactions
  - Why we need it: Frontrunning specifically targets dev transactions

  17. Slot Prediction Engine

  - What: Predicts which slot a transaction will land in
  - Technical: Analyzes leader schedule, network propagation delays, transaction priority fees to estimate inclusion
   slot
  - Why we need it: Frontrunning requires precise ordering prediction

  18. Pre-Signed Transaction Templates

  - What: Pre-signs skeleton transactions with placeholders
  - Technical: Creates transaction with dummy token mint, signs it, swaps mint address at runtime to save 10-20ms
  - Why we need it: Only needed when every millisecond counts in a race

  19. Aggressive Priority Fee Bidder

  - What: Dynamically sets very high priority fees to guarantee first position
  - Technical: Monitors competing transactions' fees, bids 10-100x average to win slot ordering
  - Why we need it: Frontrunning requires outbidding others, not just reliable inclusion

  20. Dev Buy Confirmation Detector

  - What: Detects the exact moment dev buy transaction confirms
  - Technical: Account state monitoring on bonding curve, detects reserve ratio change indicating dev buy landed
  - Why we need it: Frontrunning strategy exits immediately after dev buy

  21. Same-Slot Bundle Constructor

  - What: Bundles buy + sell in same slot/block
  - Technical: Creates transaction sequence with conditional execution, attempts atomic buy-then-sell
  - Why we need it: Frontrunning wants to enter and exit in minimal time

  22. Race Failure Detector

  - What: Identifies when bot lost the race to dev buy
  - Technical: Compares fill price to expected pre-dev price, detects if entry happened post-dev
  - Why we need it: Only matters when success is defined by beating a specific transaction

  23. Ultra-Short TTL Exit Logic

  - What: Forces exit within 5-20 seconds regardless of price
  - Technical: Sets hard deadline from entry timestamp, exits with widened slippage if dev buy doesn't appear
  - Why we need it: Frontrunning has binary outcome (hit dev window or die)

  24. Deterministic Event Sequencer

  - What: Ensures events are processed in exact order received
  - Technical: Monotonic clock synchronization, event queuing with strict ordering, detects out-of-order delivery
  - Why we need it: Frontrunning cannot tolerate processing events out of order

  25. Latency Budget Enforcer

  - What: Aborts attempt if any pipeline stage exceeds latency budget
  - Technical: Tracks microsecond timing at each stage (detect, decide, sign, submit), kills attempt if >X ms
  - Why we need it: Frontrunning has hard latency requirements (<100ms total)

  26. Co-location Network Optimizer

  - What: Routes traffic through lowest-latency paths to validators
  - Technical: Direct peering with validator nodes, QUIC protocol tuning, TCP kernel bypass
  - Why we need it: Only needed when competing in sub-50ms races
