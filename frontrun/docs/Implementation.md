Author: Chat GPT 5
Date: 2025-10-06
Target Audience: Backend/Systems Engineer (mid–senior)
Scope: Develop a low-latency Solana trading/simulation bot platform with modular strategy support.

1. Objectives

Build a modular bot platform capable of:

Sub-100 ms reaction to on-chain events via Geyser or premium RPC.

Deterministic, low-latency transaction construction and submission.

Parallel wallet/thread operation.

Secure key handling and deployment.

Focus on infrastructure and architecture, not on specific trading strategies.

Support both mainnet and devnet operation for simulation.

3. Core Modules
3.1. Event Ingestion

Goal: Capture Solana program/account changes as quickly and reliably as possible.

Inputs:

WebSocket / QUIC subscriptions to 2+ premium RPC providers.

Optional Geyser plugin stream (if running validator).

Requirements:

Parallel connections for redundancy.

Per-provider latency measurement.

Automatic reconnect with exponential backoff.

De-duplication and monotonic ordering of events.

Deliverables:

Event objects with standardized fields (program, account, slot, timestamp, raw data).

3.2. Strategy Engine

Goal: Contain strategy logic independent of network layer.

Key requirements:

Stateless per event (easy parallelization).

Support for both real trading and simulation modes.

Hooks for pre-trade filters, risk checks, decision trees.

Implementation:

Plug-in system for strategy modules (e.g., strategies/*.py or strategies/*.rs).

Should emit standardized OrderIntent objects: {wallet_id, program_id, instructions[], priority_fee, metadata}.

Simulation mode:

Record events and decisions for replay.

Store expected vs. actual inclusion metrics.

3.3. Tx Builder

Goal: Turn OrderIntent into a signed Solana transaction fast.

Requirements:

Minimal instruction sets.

Pre-allocation of transaction buffers.

Support priority fee computation (Compute Unit price).

Multi-wallet support.

Security:

Keys in memory only (per wallet).

Separate signer thread/process with strict IPC.

3.4. Tx Submitter

Goal: Reliably submit signed transactions to Solana RPCs with minimal latency.

Features:

Multiple HTTP submit targets.

Retry with exponential backoff and slot freshness check.

first_seen vs landed timestamp logging.

Handle blockhash not found, account in use gracefully.

Metrics: RTT, inclusion rate, error rates per provider.

3.5. Metrics & Logging

Centralized structured logging (JSON).

Latency budget tracing:

Event receive → decision

Decision → sign

Sign → submit

Submit → landed slot

Prometheus or OpenTelemetry export.

Grafana dashboards for:

WS RTT

Inclusion rate

Slot lag per provider

CPU/memory/network

4. Infrastructure & Deployment
4.1. Hosting Topology

Two regions, each running:

Listener Node (event ingest + strategy).

Execution Node (tx build + submit).

Blue-green deploys for safe rollouts.

Immutable container images (Docker/Nix).

4.2. Provider Selection

Benchmark 3+ RPC providers for:

p50 / p99 WS RTT.

Slot lag.

Throughput limits.

Pick best 2 for active use, 1 for standby.

4.3. System Requirements
Component	Minimum Spec	Recommended
CPU	4 cores @ 3.5+ GHz	8+ cores, high boost clock
RAM	8 GB	32 GB
Storage	NVMe SSD	NVMe Gen4
Network RTT	<70 ms to RPC	<40 ms preferred
5. Security

Hot wallets with strict isolation; rotate daily.

SSH:

Key-only auth

Bastion with hardware MFA

Secrets:

Stored in vault/KMS

Injected at runtime, not baked into images

Immediate key invalidation path (“dead man switch”).

6. Testing & Simulation

Unit tests for all modules.

Integration tests using Solana devnet:

Event → decision → tx → submit → confirmation.

Backtesting harness:

Feed historical account events.

Compare strategy output vs. simulated execution.

Canary bot in prod:

Sends harmless tx every N blocks to measure end-to-end latency.

7. CI/CD & Rollouts

CI: Lint, build, unit test, integration test.

CD: Blue-green deploy via feature flag.

Observability gates: Rollback if inclusion rate drops >X% in 2 min.

8. Documentation & Handover

Developer guide:

How to add new strategy modules.

How to run local devnet.

How to run soak tests.

Ops runbook:

✅ Key Takeaways

Treat the bot as a low-latency distributed system, not a trading script.

Clean separation of ingest, strategy, build, submit layers enables testing and legal strategies (e.g., MM, arbitrage) or paper simulation.

Proper infra, security, and observability are non-optional
