## SYBIL (5,694 detected)

**Threat Level:** HIGH

### How They Operate

Sybil clusters use multiple wallets funded by same source to simulate organic demand. They coordinate micro-buys (≤0.02 SOL) with tight timing (<250ms gaps) to pump volume metrics.

**Typical Timing:** Synchronized buys within 0-5 seconds of each other

### Common Characteristics

- Funded by same parent wallet within 90s window
- Micro-buys ≤0.02 SOL per wallet
- Very tight timing coordination (<250ms median gap)
- 6+ wallets in cluster
- Similar CU prices across cluster

### How to Avoid Getting Exploited

- Exit immediately if you see coordinated micro-buys flooding in
- Check if recent buyers share funding parents (on-chain analysis)
- Avoid tokens with >50% micro-buys in first 30s
- Set sell triggers if volume suddenly drops (sybils exiting)

### How to Exploit Their Behavior

- Front-run the sybil dump: Sell when you detect synchronized sell signals
- Wait for sybil exit before entering (better entry after fake pump clears)
- Short opportunities: Enter after sybil pump peaks, exit when real buyers arrive
- Copy their deployer's next token (if sybils profitable, deployer may repeat)

### Detection Signals

- Sudden burst of 6+ micro-buys within 3 seconds
- Low Gini coefficient (<0.3) indicating uniform buy sizes
- Multiple wallets with identical CU prices
- Funding graph shows common parent

## METRIC_BOT (1,944 detected)

**Threat Level:** CRITICAL

### How They Operate

Metric bots monitor on-chain activity and auto-buy when they detect volume/momentum bursts. They follow a template: detect burst → wait 0.5-5s → execute buy → flip within 25s.

**Typical Timing:** Buys 0.5-5 seconds after detecting a burst (15+ buys, 2.5+ SOL in 3s)

### Common Characteristics

- 50-70% of buys occur 0.5-5s after bursts
- Low inter-arrival CV (<0.4) - template timing
- Consistent delay after bursts (std <0.3s)
- Template CU prices (variance <100k)
- Fast flips: median hold <25 seconds

### How to Avoid Getting Exploited

- Don't market buy during/after bursts - you're competing with bots
- Wait 5-10s after burst peak to see if metric bots dump
- If you see fast flips (25s holds) after every burst, avoid the token
- Use limit orders below market to avoid bot-inflated prices

### How to Exploit Their Behavior

- FRONT-RUN BURST: Buy 1-2s into a forming burst, sell when bots arrive at 3-5s
- FADE THE BOTS: Short after bot buying wave completes (5-10s after burst)
- PREDICT DUMPS: Metric bots hold <25s, so sell 20-23s after burst
- BE FASTER: Use lower latency setup to beat bots to burst detection

### Detection Signals

- Sudden buy volume spike 2-5s after initial burst
- Multiple wallets buying with identical CU prices
- Sells occurring exactly 20-30s after buys (algorithmic timing)
- Inter-arrival times showing template pattern

## EARLY_EXIT (41 detected)

**Threat Level:** LOW

### How They Operate

Early exit specialists predict failed launches and dump before momentum dies. They track second burst timing - if no momentum within 30-60s, they're first sellers.

**Typical Timing:** First to sell within 30-60s of token creation if no second burst

### Common Characteristics

- First seller 40-60% of the time
- High prediction accuracy (60%+ on failed launches)
- Median hold <30s on sells
- Only sells on tokens without second burst
- Often profitable despite fast exits

### How to Avoid Getting Exploited

- If you see early exit specialist enter → watch for their sell as signal
- Their sell = strong signal token will fail (60%+ accuracy)
- Don't hold through their exit - follow their lead or exit before
- Tokens they avoid = better momentum potential

### How to Exploit Their Behavior

- INVERSE SIGNAL: If they DON'T sell after 60s, token has momentum - hold
- COPY EXITS: Follow their sells within 1-2s for safe exits on failed launches
- FADE FALSE ALARMS: Rare times they're wrong (40%), momentum is explosive
- ENTRY TIMING: If they sold and were wrong, re-enter at panic bottom

### Detection Signals

- Wallet consistently first seller on failed launches
- Sells occurring 30-60s after entry if no second burst
- High win rate despite fast exits
- Never holds through failed launches

## DEPLOYER (1,185 detected)

**Threat Level:** VARIES

### How They Operate

Token deployers create memecoins. Track their history to identify: serial scammers (rug pulls), quality deployers (successful tokens), farming bots.

**Typical Timing:** Creates token, sometimes buys immediately after

### Common Characteristics

- Created 1+ tokens
- May hold large supply
- Often buys own token to seed liquidity
- Behavior varies: some rug, some legit

### How to Avoid Getting Exploited

- Check deployer's token history before entering
- Avoid deployers with >5 failed tokens (rug pull pattern)
- Avoid if deployer holds >20% supply unfairly
- Exit if deployer dumps large position

### How to Exploit Their Behavior

- COPY GOOD DEPLOYERS: Track successful deployers, snipe their new tokens
- FADE BAD DEPLOYERS: Short tokens from known rug pullers
- TRACK SYBIL DEPLOYERS: If deployer uses sybils successfully, copy their next launch
- EARLY WARNING: Deployer sells = exit signal for everyone

### Detection Signals

- Wallet that created the token contract
- Often holds founder allocation
- May have created multiple tokens (check history)
