# Alpha Wallet Discovery System - Complete Deep Dive

## Overview

Your wallet discovery system is a **sophisticated multi-stage pipeline** that analyzes historical trade data to identify wallets with exceptional early-buying skills. It operates on completed pump cycles to avoid survivorship bias and uses advanced filtering to separate genuine alpha from luck or manipulation.

---

## 1. TIME WINDOWS & ANALYSIS PERIODS

### 1.1 Primary Analysis Window

```python
now = datetime.utcnow()
start_time = now - timedelta(minutes=60)   # 60 minutes ago
end_time = now - timedelta(minutes=5)      # 5 minutes ago
```

**Key Insight**: You analyze **55-minute completed pump cycles** (60-5 minutes ago). This avoids:
- Survivorship bias (incomplete pumps still running)
- Recency bias (too-fresh data without full cycle)
- Stale data (older than 1 hour)

### 1.2 Early Buyer Window

```python
early_window_seconds = 300  # 5 minutes (from config)
```

**Critical**: Wallets must buy within **first 5 minutes** of token launch to be considered "early buyers." This filters for genuine alpha timing vs. FOMO followers.

### 1.3 Discovery Frequency

- **Aggressive Mode**: Every 2 hours
- **Conservative Mode**: Every 6 hours  
- **Coverage**: Each run analyzes ~55 minutes of completed activity

## 2. DATA ACQUISITION PIPELINE

### 2.1 BitQuery Phase (Primary Data Source)

**Purpose**: Bulk trade data collection
**API Tokens**: 12 rotating tokens for rate limit distribution

```python
recent_trades = await self.bitquery.get_trades_windowed_paginated(
    start_iso=start_iso,
    end_iso=end_iso,
    page_limit=3000,     # 3,000 trades per page
    max_pages=20         # Up to 60,000 total trades
)
```

**What BitQuery Provides:**
- Raw trade data with timestamps
- Wallet addresses (signers)
- Token mint addresses
- Buy/sell sides
- Trade amounts in SOL/USD
- Price progression data

**Quality Gates:**
- Minimum 100 trades required
- Minimum 5 minutes of time coverage
- Validates actual timestamp ranges

### 2.2 Token Filtering & Metrics

From raw BitQuery data, the system computes:

```python
# For each token discovered:
{
    'mint': token_address,
    'launch_time': earliest_trade_timestamp,
    'swap_count': total_trades,
    'unique_traders': unique_wallet_count,
    'price_progression': [price1, price2, price3...],
    'raw_trades': all_trades_for_this_token
}
```

**Performance Calculation:**
```python
if len(price_progression) >= 2:
    early_prices = price_progression[:2]  # First 2 trades
    later_prices = price_progression[2:]  # Subsequent trades
    performance_multiplier = max(later_prices) / early_prices[0]
```

---

## 3. TOKEN SUCCESS CLASSIFICATION

### 3.1 Success Tiers (Price-Based)

**From Config:**
```yaml
discovery_success_thresholds:
  high: 2.0    # 100% gain (2x)
  medium: 1.5  # 50% gain (1.5x) 
  low: 1.2     # 20% gain (1.2x)
```

**Tier Assignment Logic:**
```python
if performance_multiplier >= 2.0:
    success_tier = 'high'
    score += 50
elif performance_multiplier >= 1.5:
    success_tier = 'medium' 
    score += 35
elif performance_multiplier >= 1.2:
    success_tier = 'low'
    score += 20
```

### 3.2 Activity-Based Fallback

If no price data available, uses trading activity:
```python
if unique_traders >= 20 and swap_count >= 40:
    success_tier = 'medium'  # High activity = medium tier
elif unique_traders >= 10 and swap_count >= 20:
    success_tier = 'low'     # Moderate activity = low tier
```

### 3.3 Additional Scoring Bonuses

**Swap Count Bonuses:**
- 30+ swaps: +20 points
- 15-29 swaps: +10 points  
- 8-14 swaps: +5 points

**Trader Count Bonuses:**
- 15+ traders: +15 points
- 8-14 traders: +8 points
- 5-7 traders: +3 points

---

## 4. MORALIS VALIDATION PHASE

### 4.1 Purpose & Limits

**API Keys**: 43 rotating keys for massive throughput
**Validation Target**: Top 30 promising tokens (reduced from all for speed)

**Validation Logic:**
```python
for token_data in promising_tokens[:30]:
    current_price = await moralis.get_current_price(mint, fresh=True)
    
    is_successful = (
        success_tier is not None and 
        bitquery_score >= 25 and
        performance_multiplier >= success_threshold
    )
```

**What Moralis Validates:**
- Token still has active price (not dead)
- Performance multiplier meets minimum threshold  
- Bitquery success score is reliable

### 4.2 Moralis Data Collection

**For Each Validated Token:**
```python
# Get comprehensive trade data
all_swaps = await moralis.get_token_swaps(mint, limit=100)

# Calculate launch-relative performance
early_swaps = [swap for swap in all_swaps 
               if launch_time <= swap_time <= launch_time + 300]
               
follow_through_swaps = [swap for swap in all_swaps
                       if launch_time + 300 <= swap_time <= launch_time + 3600]
```

**Performance Calculation:**
```python
# Early price (median of first 5 minutes)
early_buy_prices = [swap['price_usd'] for swap in early_swaps if is_buy]
early_price = median(early_buy_prices)

# Follow-through VWAP (5min - 1hr after launch)
ft_vwap = sum(price * volume) / sum(volume) for follow_through_period
performance_multiplier = ft_vwap / early_price
```

---

## 5. EARLY BUYER DETECTION

### 5.1 Dual-Source Strategy

**Primary: BitQuery Data (Fast)**
```python
# Use existing trade data from discovery
early_trades = [
    t for t in raw_trades
    if launch_time <= t['timestamp'] <= launch_time + 300  # 5 min window
    and t.get('side') == 'buy'
    and t.get('signer')  # Valid wallet address
]
```

**Fallback: Moralis API (Comprehensive)**
```python
# If BitQuery coverage insufficient
all_swaps = await moralis.get_token_swaps(mint, limit=100)
early_swaps = [swap for swap in all_swaps 
               if launch_time <= swap_time <= launch_time + 300]
```

### 5.2 Position Size Filtering

**From Config:**
```yaml
discovery_position_filters:
  min_position_usd: 100    # Minimum $100 position
  max_position_usd: 5000   # Maximum $5,000 position
```

**Purpose**: Filter out noise trades (too small) and whale manipulation (too large)

```python
def _is_significant_position(self, trade_data: Dict) -> bool:
    usd_size = self._get_trade_size_usd(trade_data)
    return 100 <= usd_size <= 5000
```

---

## 6. WASH TRADING DETECTION

### 6.1 Co-occurrence Analysis

**Detection Logic:**
```python
# Build co-occurrence matrix
for wallet, token_list in candidates.items():
    for token in wallet_tokens:
        for other_wallet in candidates:
            if other_wallet != wallet:
                if token in other_wallet_tokens:
                    co_occurrence_matrix[wallet][other_wallet] += 1
```

**Filtering Criteria:**
```yaml
discovery_quality_checks:
  max_co_occurrence_rate: 0.3  # 30% max overlap
  min_tokens_for_check: 5      # Need 5+ tokens for analysis
```

**Flagging Logic:**
```python
co_occurrence_rate = max_co_occurrence / wallet_token_count
if co_occurrence_rate > 0.30:  # 30% threshold
    suspicious_wallets.add(wallet)
```

### 6.2 Purpose

Prevents discovery of coordinated wallet clusters that:
- Always buy the same tokens together
- Are funded by the same source  
- Execute coordinated pump schemes

## 7. WALLET SCORING ALGORITHM

### 7.1 Multi-Tier Classification

**Tier Requirements:**
```yaml
discovery_min_appearances:
  tier_1: 2  # 2+ high success tokens (≥100% gain)
  tier_2: 3  # 3+ medium success tokens (≥50% gain)
  tier_3: 4  # 4+ low success tokens (≥20% gain)
```

**Tier Qualification Logic:**
```python
high_count = wallet_success_tiers.count('high')
medium_count = wallet_success_tiers.count('medium') 
low_count = wallet_success_tiers.count('low')

if high_count >= 2:
    wallet_tier = 'tier_1'  # Premium alpha wallet
elif medium_count >= 3:
    wallet_tier = 'tier_2'  # Good alpha wallet  
elif low_count >= 4:
    wallet_tier = 'tier_3'  # Emerging alpha wallet
```

### 7.2 Comprehensive Scoring Formula

```python
# Base scores by tier
tier_multipliers = {'tier_1': 3.0, 'tier_2': 2.0, 'tier_3': 1.5}
tier_base_score = tier_multipliers[wallet_tier] * 100

# Performance bonuses
performance_bonus = avg_performance * 25
success_bonus = success_rate * 40
volume_bonus = len(token_list) * 10
risk_adjusted_bonus = avg_risk_adjusted_return * 15

# NEW: Quality bonuses  
exit_timing_bonus = avg_exit_quality * 30
consistency_bonus = consistency_score * 20

# Recency decay (12-hour half-life)
recency_weight = exp(-time_diff / (12 * 3600))

final_score = (tier_base_score + performance_bonus + success_bonus + 
               volume_bonus + risk_adjusted_bonus + exit_timing_bonus + 
               consistency_bonus) * avg_recency
```

### 7.3 Advanced Quality Metrics

**Exit Timing Analysis:**
```python
async def _analyze_exit_timing(self, wallet: str, token_list: List[Dict]) -> float:
    # For each token wallet traded:
    # 1. Find wallet's buy transactions
    # 2. Find wallet's sell transactions  
    # 3. Calculate peak price in between
    # 4. Measure how close to peak they sold
    exit_efficiency = actual_gain / potential_gain
    return average_exit_efficiency  # 0.0-1.0 score
```

**Consistency Scoring:**
```python
def _calculate_consistency(self, performance_multipliers, recency_weights) -> float:
    variance = statistics.variance(performance_multipliers)
    # Lower variance = higher consistency
    consistency = max(0, 1.0 - (variance / 1.0))
    return consistency  # 0.0-1.0 score
```

### 7.4 Quality Filters

**Final Quality Gates:**
```yaml
discovery_quality_checks:
  min_exit_quality: 0.5      # 50% exit timing efficiency
  min_consistency: 0.53      # 53% consistency score
```

Wallets failing these final checks are excluded regardless of other metrics.

## 8. WALLET WEIGHTING IN TRADING

### 8.1 Bayesian Scoring System

**Prior Distribution**: Beta(3,5) = ~37.5% baseline win rate

**Fresh Wallet Handling:**
```python
def get_wallet_score(self, wallet: str) -> float:
    if wallet not in self.wallet_stats:
        # Fresh discovery wallets get 65% confidence
        return 0.65  # Higher than 37.5% prior due to rigorous filtering
```

**Ongoing Updates:**
```python
# After each trade outcome
posterior_alpha = prior_alpha + wins
posterior_beta = prior_beta + losses  
wallet_confidence = posterior_alpha / (posterior_alpha + posterior_beta)
```

### 8.2 Tier-Based Investment Multipliers

**Position Sizing by Tier:**
```python
tier_investment_multipliers = {
    'S': 1.00,   # 100% of base position (5% of capital)
    'A': 0.90,   # 90% of base position (4.5% of capital)
    'B': 0.80,   # 80% of base position (4.0% of capital) 
    'C': 0.70    # 70% of base position (3.5% of capital)
}
# Unknown/new wallets: 0.60 (60% = 3.0% of capital)
```
