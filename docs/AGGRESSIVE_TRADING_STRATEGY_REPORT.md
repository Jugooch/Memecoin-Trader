## 1. ALPHA WALLET DISCOVERY SYSTEM

### 1.1 Discovery Process Parameters

Your alpha wallet discovery operates on a **time-delayed analysis** approach using multiple quality filters:

**Core Discovery Settings:**
- **Analysis Window**: 60-5 minutes ago (analyzes completed pump cycles)
- **Success Thresholds**: 
  - High: 2.0x (100% gain)
  - Medium: 1.5x (50% gain) 
  - Low: 1.2x (20% gain)
- **Early Window**: 5 minutes (300 seconds) - wallets must buy within first 5 minutes
- **Minimum Token Coverage**: 20 tokens minimum for analysis

**Quality Filters Applied:**

1. **Multi-Tier Wallet Classification:**
   - **Tier 1**: 2+ high success tokens (≥2.0x)
   - **Tier 2**: 3+ medium success tokens (≥1.5x)  
   - **Tier 3**: 4+ low success tokens (≥1.2x)

2. **Position Size Filtering:**
   - Minimum: $100 USD
   - Maximum: $5,000 USD
   - *Filters out noise trades and whale manipulation*

3. **Wash Trading Detection:**
   - **Max Co-occurrence Rate**: 30%
   - **Minimum Tokens for Check**: 5 tokens
   - *Prevents coordinated wallet clusters*

4. **Consistency Requirements:**
   - **Minimum Consistency Score**: 53%
   - **Minimum Exit Quality**: 50%
   - *Ensures wallets are skilled, not lucky*

### 1.2 Data Sources & API Usage

**Primary Data Sources:**
- **BitQuery**: 12 rotating API tokens for trade data
- **Moralis**: 43 rotating API keys for validation
- **Coverage**: Up to 60,000 trades per discovery run (20 pages × 3,000 trades)

**Discovery Frequency:**
- **Conservative Mode**: Every 6 hours
- **Aggressive Mode**: Every 2 hours
- **Maximum Wallets**: 100 total (manageable for real-time tracking)

### 1.3 Wallet Scoring Algorithm

```
Final Score = (Tier Base Score × 100) + Performance Bonus + Success Bonus + 
              Volume Bonus + Risk-Adjusted Bonus + Exit Timing Bonus + 
              Consistency Bonus) × Recency Factor
```

**Score Components:**
- **Tier Multipliers**: Tier 1: 3.0, Tier 2: 2.0, Tier 3: 1.5
- **Performance Bonus**: Average performance × 25
- **Success Bonus**: Success rate × 40
- **Recency Decay**: 12-hour half-life

---

## 2. BUY TRIGGER MECHANISMS

### 2.1 Single Wallet Trigger System

**Aggressive Configuration:**
- **Alpha Weight Minimum**: 0.6 (reduced from 3.5)
- **Minimum Confidence**: 10.0 (weight × 20)
- **Threshold Alpha Buys**: 1 wallet (reduced from 5)
- **Independent Wallets Required**: 1 (reduced from 3)

**Signal Calculation:**
```python
confidence = wallet_weight × 20
if confidence >= 10.0 and alpha_buys >= 1:
    trigger_buy()
```

### 2.2 Enhanced Alpha Detection

**Correlation Penalties:**
- **Frequent Co-buyers**: 60% penalty
- **Some Co-buyers**: 90% penalty  
- **Shared Funders**: 80% penalty

**Time-Based Analysis:**
- **Max Time Spread**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Correlation Threshold**: 500ms for timing analysis

### 2.3 Speed Optimizations

**Ultra-Fast Execution Mode:**
- **API Polls**: Reduced to 2 maximum
- **Poll Intervals**: [1, 3, 5] seconds
- **Early Abort Thresholds**: 
  - Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.5
  - Minimum Buyers: 5

**Cache TTL (Aggressive):**
- **Price Data**: 3 seconds
- **Swap Data**: 5 seconds  
- **Liquidity**: 300 seconds

---

## 3. SAFETY BYPASS SYSTEM ("SMART SKIP")

### 3.1 Hybrid Safety Configuration

Your strategy uses **intelligent safety bypasses** based on wallet confidence and signal strength:

**Bypass Thresholds:**
- **Ultra-Confidence**: 80% - Skip ALL safety checks
- **High-Confidence**: 70% - Skip sellability only
- **S-Tier Bypass**: S-tier wallets bypass all safety
- **Signal Strength Bypass**: ≥4.0 signal strength

**Safety Categories:**
1. **"all"** - Skip all safety (S-tier, 80%+ confidence, 4.0+ signal)
2. **"partial"** - Skip sellability only (70%+ confidence, 3.5+ signal) 
3. **"none"** - Full safety checks (everything else)

### 3.2 Remaining Safety Checks

When safety is enabled, these checks are still performed:

**Price Impact Limits:**
- **Maximum Impact**: 5% (increased from 0.8%)
- **Estimated via**: Recent trade size analysis

**Extension Guard:**
- **Percentile Threshold**: 95th percentile
- **Analysis Window**: 60 seconds of price data

**Sellability Requirements:**
- **Minimum Sellers**: 1 distinct seller (reduced)
- **Max Failure Rate**: 20% (increased from 5%)
- **Analysis Window**: 30 seconds (reduced)

## 4. TRADING EXECUTION FLOW

### 4.1 Real-Time Data Source

**Primary**: PumpPortal WebSocket
- **WebSocket**: `wss://pumpportal.fun/api/data`
- **Latency Advantage**: ~2-5 second improvement over Moralis

### 4.2 Transaction Execution

**Execution Parameters:**
- **Max Entry Delay**: 15 seconds (reduced from 180)
- **Slippage Tolerance**: 1% buy, 1.5% sell
- **Position Size**: 3% of capital per trade (reduced for frequency)

### 4.3 Real-Time Position Management

**NEW FEATURE**: Instant position updates via WebSocket

**Traditional Flow** (SLOW):
```
Buy TX → Wait 30-60s → Query blockchain → Update position → Monitor
```

**Real-Time Flow** (FAST):
```  
Buy TX → WebSocket Event → Instant Position Update → Monitor
```

**Benefits:**
- **5-15 second improvement** in position awareness
- **Immediate** profit/loss calculations
- **No blockchain polling** delays

---

## 5. TAKE PROFIT STRATEGY

### 5.1 Multi-Tier Exit System

**Tier Configuration:**
- **TP1 (25% gain)**: Sell 45% of position
- **TP2 (50% gain)**: Sell 35% of position  
- **TP3 (100% gain)**: Sell 15% of position
- **Remaining 5%**: Rides with tight trailing stop

### 5.2 Profit Taking Logic

```python
if price >= tp1_price and tp1_not_hit:
    sell_percentage = 0.45  # 45%
    position.tp1_hit_time = now()
    
elif price >= tp2_price and tp1_hit and tp2_not_hit:
    sell_percentage = 0.35  # 35%
    position.tp2_hit_time = now()
    
elif price >= tp3_price and tp2_hit and tp3_not_hit:
    sell_percentage = 0.15  # 15%
    position.tp3_hit_time = now()
```

### 5.3 Adaptive Trailing Stops

**Multi-Tier Aware Trailing:**
- **After TP1+TP2 (80% sold)**: 5% trailing stop on remaining 20%
- **After TP1 (45% sold)**: 10% trailing stop on remaining 55%
- **No Profits Taken**: 15% trailing stop on full position

**Gain-Based Trailing:**
- **100%+ gains**: 25% trailing (very loose for moonshots)
- **60%+ gains**: 20% trailing  
- **30%+ gains (fast)**: 15% trailing

---

## 6. STOP LOSS STRATEGY

### 6.1 Time-Based Aggressive Stops

Your stop loss uses **time-sensitive** levels based on holding period:

**Stop Loss Schedule:**
- **0-5 minutes**: 15% stop loss (85% of entry)
- **5-10 minutes**: 20% stop loss (80% of entry)
- **10+ minutes**: 25% stop loss (75% of entry)

### 6.2 Scratch Rule (Early Exit)

**Conditions:**
- **Time Window**: First 45 seconds only
- **Drawdown Threshold**: 4% from peak
- **P&L Range**: -3% to -2% (scratch exit zone)
- **Buyer Acceleration**: Must be negative

**Purpose**: Exit early weakness before it becomes major loss

### 6.3 Break-Even Protection

**Arming Conditions:**
- **After Profits Banked**: 5% gain triggers break-even
- **No Profits Banked**: 8% gain triggers break-even
- **Protection Duration**: 60 seconds
- **Buffer**: 0.5-1% above entry price

## 7. POSITION MANAGEMENT

### 7.1 Position Sizing

**Capital Allocation:**
- **Initial Capital**: $1,000
- **Per Trade**: 3% ($30 per trade)
- **Max Concurrent**: 10 positions
- **Max Daily Trades**: 1,000 (high frequency)

### 7.2 Position Tracking Systems

**Dual System Architecture:**

1. **Legacy System** (being phased out):
   - Blockchain polling every 5-15 seconds
   - Manual balance queries
   - High latency position updates

2. **Real-Time System** (new):
   - WebSocket-driven updates
   - Instant position awareness  
   - No blockchain polling needed

### 7.3 Race Condition Prevention

**Selling Locks:**
```python
if position.is_selling:
    return {"success": False, "error": "Position already being sold"}
position.is_selling = True
```

**Verification Systems:**
- **Transaction Parsing**: Parse actual SOL received from TX logs
- **Balance Verification**: Cross-check with token account balances
- **Cost Basis Tracking**: Track original SOL invested for accurate P&L

## 8. LATENCY OPTIMIZATIONS

### 8.1 Data Source Strategy

**Primary Sources (Speed Ranked):**
1. **PumpPortal WebSocket** (fastest) - 2-5s advantage
2. **Direct RPC Calls** (fast) - for balance checks

### 8.2 API Optimization Settings

**Aggressive Polling:**
- **Alpha Poll Intervals**: [1, 3, 5] seconds
- **Max Polls**: 2 (reduced from standard 5)
- **Early Abort**: Stop polling if buy/sell ratio < 0.5

**Cache Strategy:**
- **Price TTL**: 3 seconds (very fresh)
- **Swap TTL**: 5 seconds  
- **Liquidity TTL**: 5 minutes

### 8.3 Real-Time Position Updates

**WebSocket Integration:**
- **Self-Wallet Monitoring**: Your trading wallet is subscribed to PumpPortal
- **Instant Updates**: Position changes reflected immediately
- **No Polling**: Eliminates 5-15 second blockchain query delays
